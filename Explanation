## Introduction23This assignment uses data from4the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine5Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning6datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household7electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on8the course web site:91011* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]1213* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in14one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost154 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values16are available.171819The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken20from21the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">UCI22web site</a>:2324<ol>25<li><b>Date</b>: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy </li>26<li><b>Time</b>: time in format hh:mm:ss </li>27<li><b>Global_active_power</b>: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt) </li>28<li><b>Global_reactive_power</b>: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt) </li>29<li><b>Voltage</b>: minute-averaged voltage (in volt) </li>30<li><b>Global_intensity</b>: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere) </li>31<li><b>Sub_metering_1</b>: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy).
